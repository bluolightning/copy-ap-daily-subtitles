# Usage Instructions

This program copies the subtitles of AP videos on AP Classroom (unaffiliated).

1. Open bookmarklet.txt and copy the code
2. Right click on the bookmark bar and hit 'Add page' (or similar text)
3. Paste the code into a browser bookmark's url
4. Name the bookmark whatever you want
5. Open the AP Classroom site and click the bookmarklet

- If it isn't working or is copying multiple times, try refreshing the page and clicking the bookmarklet again

Pressing 'c' copies the current subtitle to the clipboard. (The exact key can be customized in the code)

To customize which key needs to be pressed to copy the subtitle, alter the 'key' variable in the code (it's on line 3 in bookmarklet.txt).
```const key = '<the key you want to press>'```
